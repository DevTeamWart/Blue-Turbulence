The year is 2008.

The events leading to the rise of the megacorporations began on July 2, 1993, with the Sadness Event. Following decades of radicalization, a global coordinated terrorist attack killed a million people within five hours. Afterwards, the people wanted it. They wanted to be drugged.

They, the people, demanded surveillance. Demanded the end of privacy. And they got it. Governments eventually gave way to meganations, and it wasnâ€™t long until they ruled over the masses.

It has now been 15 years since the Sadness Event.
